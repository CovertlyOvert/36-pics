# ðŸ“¸ 36 Pics

A minimalist, retro-inspired Flutter app that limits users to just **36 photos per trip**, capturing the joy of mindful photography â€” like old film cameras.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept

On vacations or weekend trips, we often get lost in taking *too many* pictures, losing the moment itself.  
**36 Pics** reintroduces that nostalgic constraint â€” you get **only 36 shots** per trip, so every photo counts.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ§  **Trip-based memory management**: Start a named trip session
- ðŸ“· **Mock camera interface**: Tap to simulate taking photos
- ðŸ”¢ **Photo counter**: Clearly shows progress out of 36
- ðŸ–¼ **Gallery view**: See mock photo "names" in a grid layout
- ðŸŽ¯ **Hard limit**: After 36 photos, shutter is disabled

> This is currently a **mock prototype**. Real camera/photo storage to be integrated in future versions.
